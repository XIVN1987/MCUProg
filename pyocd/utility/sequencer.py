## @brief Call sequence manager.
#
# Contains an ordered sequence of tasks. Each task has a name and associated
# callable. The CallSequence class itself is callable, so instances can be nested
# as tasks within other CallSequences.
#
# When tasks within a sequence are called, they may optionally return a new CallSequence
# instance. If this happens, the new sequence is executed right away, before continuing
# with the next task in the original sequence.
#
# A CallSequence can be iterated over. It will return tuples of (task-name, callable).

    # set of tasks. Each parameter must be a 2-tuple with the first element being the
    # task's name and the second element a callable that implements the task. If you
    # need to pass parameters to the callable, use a lambda.
